write(..)       Write each argument string to the screen, seperated by spaces.

writeln(..)     As above, but ends the current line.

writef(..)      Write formatted output. The first argument is a format string,
                which may contain the following special sequences:
                    %%  is replaced by %
                    %s  is replaced by the next argument formatted as a string
                    %i  is replaced by the next argument formatted as a
                        decimal integer
                    %d  is equivalent to %i


choice(..)      Takes two or more string arguments. The first argument is the
                query to display, the rest are the options. The result is one
                of the option arguments.

pause()         Waits for user input before continuing.

quit()          End the game. Does not return.

restart()       Restarts the module, by reseting all variables to nil and
                calling the initialization function again. Takes effect after
                all current invocations have completed.
