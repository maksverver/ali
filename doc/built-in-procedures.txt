write(..)       Write each argument string to the screen, seperated by spaces.

writeln(..)     As above, but ends the current line.
                writeln("x") is equivalent to write("x\n")

writef(..)      Write formatted output. The first argument is a format string,
                which may contain the following special sequences:
                    %%  is replaced by %
                    %s  is replaced by the next argument formatted as a string
                    %i  is replaced by the next argument formatted as a
                        decimal integer
                    %d  is equivalent to %i
                The effect is the same as passing the string obtained after
                applying substitutions to write().

pause()         Waits for user input before continuing.

quit()          End the game. Does not return.

reset()         Resets all variables to nil.
