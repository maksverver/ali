- Check memory use with valgrind (interpreter only?)

alic: (all of these can wait till later:)
 - Support for forward declarations of functions/procedures?

ali:
 - Revise line wrapping.
   Design and implementation should be simpler.

   We'd like to accomodate for easy writing of large paragraphs, writing
   blank rows between paragraphs, allow specific formatting with writef,
   but still allow the user to do indentation.


 Implement line wrapping when printing. Ensure input/output are seperated by
   a blank line. See built-in-procedures.txt for details.
 - Better line reading (readline? libedit? How to do portably?)
 - Port to Windows
 - Implement transcript logging
   include time, commands, output
 - Implement state saving/restoring (just store the transcript?)
 - Should check that strings in string table are zero-terminated
Low priority:
 - Use zlib to read gzip compressed module file
 - BUG: the interpreter will hang on (nearly) infinite loops
