- Check memory use with valgrind (interpreter only?)

alic: (all of these can wait till later:)
 - Support for forward declarations of functions/procedures?

ali:
 - Implement line wrapping when printing. Ensure input/output are seperated by
   a blank line. See built-in-procedures.txt for details.
 - Better line reading (readline? libedit? How to do portably?)
 - Port to Windows
 - Implement transcript logging
   include time, commands, output
 - Implement state saving/restoring (just store the transcript?)
Low priority:
 - Use zlib to read gzip compressed module file
 - BUG: the interpreter will hang on (nearly) infinite loops
