- check memory use with valgrind (interpreter only?)

alic: (all of these can wait till later:)
 - Check for procedure calls in expressions (these are forbidden!)
 - Check for multiply declared commands
 - Implement dumping of debug data

ali:
 - Implement command parsing
 - Implement interpreter loop
 - Implement transcript logging
 - Implement state saving/restoring (just store the transcript?)
BUGS:
 - The interpreter crashes on infinite recursion, or if the stack size is
   increased endlessly.
 - The interpreter will hang on infinite loops

alidump:
 - Allow user to select which parts of the module to print
   (Very simple command line options?)
