- Check memory use with valgrind (interpreter only?)

alic: (all of these can wait till later:)
 - Check for procedure calls in expressions (these are forbidden!)
 - Check for multiply declared commands
 - Implement dumping of debug data
 - Support for forward declarations of functions/procedures?

ali:
 - Better line reading (readline? How to do portably?)
 - Implement transcript logging
   include time, commands, output
 - Implement state saving/restoring (just store the transcript?)
BUGS:
 - The interpreter will hang on (nearly) infinite loops
