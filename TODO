Most Important Item: write an actual game!

alic:
 - (maybe later:) support for forward declarations of functions/procedures?
 - remove duplicates from fragment lists generated from fragment patterns.

ali:
 - BUG: the interpreter will hang on (nearly) infinite loops

library:
 - make linking with LZMA SDK code optional?

General:
- Check memory use with valgrind (interpreter only?)
  Must disable mudflap before doing this.
- (maybe later:) richer fragment matching (e.g. "[THE] [BIG] (BOX/CHEST)")

Documentation:
 - finish language documentation
Later:
 - write tutorial?
